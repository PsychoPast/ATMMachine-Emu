# ATMMachine-Emu
Final CSC314 Java project at USEK on which I got the highest score. We were asked to develop a gui application that emulates atm transactions.

Please make sure that all the images/gifs are inside the "assets" folder
the "data" folder contains accounts.bin from which the app reads the stored accounts at runtime and writes to it upon saving

Here are some pre-registered accounts:
ID: 820287711647162
PIN: 5920

ID: 348804637686182
PIN: 0491

ID: 106551342862208
PIN: 6710

for the atm: 
left-click on a $1,$5, etc... button will add the written value to the amount
right-click on a $1,$5, etc... button will sub the written value from the amount
